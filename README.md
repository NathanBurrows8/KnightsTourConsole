# KnightsTourConsole
An initial prototype in C++ for my dissertation project, KnightTourSolver. I ended up switching to Java for an easier UI development.

A Knight Tour is a series of moves on a chessboard in which the Knight visits every square once. 

This is ran completely in the console. A user can change the board dimensions (either square or rectangular), and after selecting a starting square, the program attempts to compute a valid open knight tour (if it exists) for the parameters given.
